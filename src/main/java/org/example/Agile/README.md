## When to use agile over waterfall
- Waterfall is a better method when a project must meet strict regulations 
  as it requires deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the next one. 
  Alternatively, Agile is better suited for teams that plan on moving fast, 
  experimenting with direction and don't know how the final project will look 
  before they start.


## Roles and responsibilities when following scrum methodology
- **Product Owner:** The scrum product owner is usually a project's key stakeholder.
  Typically, someone from marketing or product management, or the lead user of a 
  system. They have deep understanding of users, the marketplace, competitors, and 
  trends.

- **Scrum master:** A scrum master is a facilitator and coach who helps the scrum 
  team and broader organisation understand and apply scrum theory and practice.

- **Developer:** They are people in the scrum team that are committed to creating any
  aspect of usable increment each sprint. 


##  Scrum ceremonies
- **Sprint planning:** Sprint planning is an event that kicks off the sprint.
  The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the 
  sprint and how that work will be achieved.

- **Stand up:** The daily stand-up is a short, daily meeting to discuss progress 
  and identify blockers. The reason it's called a “stand-up” is because if 
  attendees participate while standing, the meeting should be kept short.

- **Sprint review:** A sprint review is an informal meeting held at the end of a 
  sprint, during which the team shows what was accomplished, while the 
  stakeholders provide feedback. It's a collaborative working session rather 
  than a one-sided presentation. It focuses on improving the product.

- **Sprint retrospective:** The sprint retrospective is an opportunity for the 
  scrum team to inspect itself and create a plan for the improvements to be enacted 
  during the next sprint. 


## Difference between a story, bug and task in jira
- Jira *Tasks* are part of a *Story*, and function as single to-dos that are 
  generally completed by one person in a day or less. Whereas a *Story* will 
  express a goal or end result, a *Task* is a responsibility or step in the 
  process. Stories may consist of multiple Tasks, which may be done in tandem 
  or in sequential order.

- A bug is a problem which impairs or prevents the functions of a product. 
- A user story is the smallest unit of work that needs to be done. 
- A task represents work that needs to be done. 
- A subtask is a piece of work that is required to complete a task.
