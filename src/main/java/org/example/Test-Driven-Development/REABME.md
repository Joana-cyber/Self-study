# Test Driven Development

## What is Test Driven Development
- Test-driven development (TDD) is defined as **an iterative methodology that prioritizes the creation of and checking against 
  test cases at every stage of software development**, by converting each component of the application into a test case before it is 
  built and then testing and tracking the component repeatedly.


## Advantages of Test Driven 
-  in TDD, **tests guide the implementation.** This results in **easier to maintain and better-quality code**, but at the same time, 
   increases the initial development time. TDD is an effective specification technique that also ensures effective unit testing and 
   results through 100% test coverage.
